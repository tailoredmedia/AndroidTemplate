# This Template has been DEPRECATED

Use [AndroidAppTemplate](https://github.com/tailoredmedia/AndroidAppTemplate) instead.

-----------

># TA Android Template
>
>This is the Tailored Apps Android app template which can be used for new projects. A small example app is available at the example branch.
>
>The basic app structure is taken from the [Countries Example app](https://github.com/patloew/countries), which is Apache 2.0 licensed.
>
>## Technologies used
>
>* Kotlin
>* Dagger 2 for dependency injection
>* Retrofit/OkHttp/Gson for networking
>* Realm for local data storage
>* MVVM as architectural pattern
>
>## App structure
>
>* Dagger components, modules, scopes and qualifiers for dependency injection are located in the `injection` package.
>* Model classes are located in the `data.model` package.
>* Network related classes and interfaces (e.g. Retrofit services) are located in the `data.remote` package.
>* Local storage related classes (e.g. repositories) are located in the `data.local` package.
>* UI related classes (Activities, Fragments, Views, ...) are located in the `ui` package. For each aspect of an app create a new subpackage. Use the interfaces and abstract classes from the `base` subpackage.
>* Util classes are located in the `util` package.
>
>## Dev hints
>
>* Your bindings must have a variable named `vm`, with type of your ViewModel class. Do not put logic in your layouts, instead create a property in your view model.
>* Your view classes (Activities, Fragments, ViewHolders) must implement `MvvmView` (usually, a new subinterface of `MvvmView`, specifying the callbacks for the specific view).
>* Your ViewModel class should extend `BaseStateViewModel<MvvmView, YourInnerStateClass>` if you have some state (e.g. when you have a form with user inputs) or `BaseViewModel<MvvmView>` if you don't have any state.
>    * The base classes provide basic view attach/detach methods. 
>    * When you extended `BaseStateViewModel`, the State should be contained in a static inner class in the view model. This class must also be available for injection via an `@Inject` annotated constructor. Also, the class must be annotated with `@Parcel`, because Parceler is used for automatic saving/restoring of the state in the base class. This state class can also extend BaseObservable, for notifying the binding of changes. However, you can should instead use ObservableFields, ObservableBoolean, … to simplify bindings. Then you have to provide appropriate `@ParcelConverter` annotations to the fields – implementations of the most common types are available in the util package.
>    * You can extend the `BaseValidator` class to validate the state.
>* Base classes for views
>    * These classes provide a binding and viewModel field. The viewModel gets injected, the binding has to be set manually.
>    * Detaching of the view model is handled by the base classes.
>    * Don't forget to create a  `inject()` method in the Dagger component for each Activity/Fragment/ViewHolder.
>    * Activities should extend `BaseActivity<Binding, View, ViewModel>`. You should use `setAndBindContentView(savedInstanceState, layoutResId)`, which sets the content view, creates the binding and attaches the view.
>    * Fragments should extend `BaseFragment<Binding, View, ViewModel>`. You should use `setAndBindContentView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState, layoutResId)`, which sets the content view, creates the binding and attaches the view.
>    * ViewHolders should extend BaseActivity/FragmentViewHolder<Binding, View, ViewModel>. You should use `bindContentView(view)`, which creates the binding and attaches the view.
>* The `template_version` property in `.template_plugin_config.json` is increased each time classes under the `.ui.base` package change.
>
>## Testing
>
>* Write unit tests for each view model. You can use Mockito/PowerMock to mock objects and verify correct behaviour. Add the `RxSchedulersOverrideRule` for preventing errors when using RxJava.
>* Write UI tests for common actions in your app. Use JUnit 4 Tests with Espresso. Some helper methods are available in `EspressoUtils`.
