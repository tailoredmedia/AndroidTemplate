/**
 * Base class that implements the ViewModel interface and provides a base implementation for
 * attachView() and detachView(). It also handles keeping a reference to the mvvmView that
 * can be accessed from the children classes by calling getMvpView().

 * When saving state is required, restoring is handled automatically when calling attachView().
 * However, saveInstanceState() must still be called in the corresponding lifecycle callback.
